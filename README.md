    Technologies were used:
  In this project, I developed a phone catalog using modern web development technologies:

  - **React**: Utilized React to build a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing users to browse and filter phone models efficiently.
  - **TypeScript**: Integrated TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality, enhancing the development experience with better tooling and error checking.
  - **React Router**: Implemented React Router to manage navigation within the application, enabling a seamless user experience with multiple views and dynamic URL routing.
  - **HTML5**: Structured the website using semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and improve SEO performance.
  - **SCSS**: Styled the application using SCSS for modular and maintainable CSS, allowing for better organization and reuse of styles.
  Responsive Design: Ensured the website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and providing a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
  - **Git**: Used Git for version control, tracking changes and collaborating effectively during the development process.
  - **Redux**: The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why, and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application logic will behave when those changes occur. Redux guides you towards writing code that is predictable and testable, which helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.
